<!-- Add paragraph element to body with text “The Document Object Model (DOM) is a 
programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs 
can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as 
nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.”
• Set the paragraph text color to purple
• Add another paragraph to body with text” A Web page is a document. This document can be 
either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in 
both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be 
manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be 
modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.”
• Set another paragraph text color to red
• Set the body color to light grey -->
